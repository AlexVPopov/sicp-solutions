# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Solutions)

This repo contains my take on the problems, presented in the book
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).
The solution to each task is in a separate file and the files are grouped by
chapter. So, for example, the solution to problem 1.3 is contained in
[chapter1/6.scm](chapter1/6.scm). It is currently a work-in-progress.

## How to run the files

1. Install [mit-scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/).
1. Clone the repo.
1. Navigate to the root directory.
1. From the terminal, pass a file to the `scheme` executable, e.g., `scheme < chapter1/3.scm`.
